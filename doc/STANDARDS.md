Coding standards and conventions
================================

Still to come ...

General file standards are managed through .editorconfig

Typescript code standards are managed through TSLint (in the tslint.json file)

Files and folders are always camelCase except for markdown documentation files
which are CAPITALS.md

Follow function-oriented programming patterns - avoid classes.

etc
